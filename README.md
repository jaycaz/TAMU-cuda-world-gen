# cuda-world-gen
A parallel implementation of the Donjon Fractal World Generator using CUDA

## Build Instructions

Currently, the project requires Windows, an NVIDIA CUDA-enabled graphics card, and the CUDA toolkit in order to build.
To build this project, open the "cuda-world-gen.sln" file in Visual Studio and use the Build command.

## Running the .exe

This version of the program runs an interactive mode that will allow you to specify whether to run the sequential or 
parallel algorithm, how many "faults" (i.e. iterations) you want to run it for, and how many trials you want to run it for.
The times that are given are averaged from all of the trials.
